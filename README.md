# 🚦 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

An interactive **Power BI dashboard** designed to analyze and visualize road accident data.  
This project provides clear insights into accident severity, vehicle involvement, road conditions, and time-based trends to support data-driven decision making.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Road Accident Dashboard** helps stakeholders:

- Understand accident severity distribution
- Analyze monthly casualty trends (Current Year vs Previous Year)
- Identify high-risk road types and conditions
- Compare urban vs rural accident distribution
- Evaluate impact of light and weather conditions
- Filter data dynamically by Year and Day

This dashboard transforms raw accident data into meaningful, visual insights.

- Slight Severity  
Displayed using donut charts for quick comparison.

---

### 2️⃣ Vehicle Involvement
- 🚗 Cars
- 🏍 Motorcycles
- 🚌 Buses
- 🚜 Tractors
- 🚚 Tempo
- 🚙 Other Vehicles  

Helps identify which vehicle types are most frequently involved in accidents.

---

### 3️⃣ Monthly Casualty Trend (CY vs PY)
- Comparison between **Current Year (2022)** and **Previous Year (2021)**
- Detects growth or decline in accident cases
- Useful for trend analysis and forecasting

---

### 4️⃣ Casualties by Road Type
- Single Carriageway
- Dual Carriageway
- Roundabout
- One Way
- Slip Road

Identifies which road infrastructure contributes most to accidents.

---

### 5️⃣ Urban vs Rural Analysis
Clear distribution of accident occurrences across:
- Urban Areas
- Rural Areas

---

### 6️⃣ Light Condition Analysis
- Daylight
- Dark

Evaluates accident occurrence based on visibility conditions.

---

### 7️⃣ Weather Condition Impact
- Dry
- Wet
- Other Conditions

Helps understand environmental risk factors.

---

### 8️⃣ Interactive Filters
- 📅 Year Selector (2019–2022)
- 📆 Day Selector (Monday–Sunday)
- 🏙 Urban / Rural Toggle

Users can dynamically explore the data.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Power BI Desktop**

---


## 🌟 Key Data Insights

This dashboard uncovers clear and actionable accident patterns:

- 📊 **Slight severity dominates** – High frequency incidents indicate systemic risk.
- 🚗 **Cars & Motorcycles lead involvement** – Private vehicle safety is critical.
- 🛣 **Single carriageways are high-risk zones** – Infrastructure plays a key role.
- 🌆 **Urban areas show higher volume**, while rural areas may show higher severity.
- 🌤 **Daylight accidents exceed dark conditions** – Traffic density impacts more than visibility.
- 🌧 **Most accidents occur in dry conditions** – Risk behavior during normal weather is underestimated.
- 📈 **2022 shows growth trend vs 2021** – Possible increase in traffic volume or behavioral risks.

---

## 💡 Final Perspective

Road accidents are not random events.

They follow identifiable patterns influenced by:
- Infrastructure
- Traffic density
- Human behavior
- Environmental conditions

This dashboard converts raw accident data into strategic intelligence for safer roads and smarter policy decisions.
